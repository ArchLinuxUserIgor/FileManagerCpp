# FileManagerCpp

**FileManagerCpp** is a file manager written in C++/Qt.  


## 📝 Change Log

    ✅ Fixed "Cut" functionality: The "Cut" operation now works correctly and without errors.  
    ✅ Improved error messages: Fixed duplicated or malformed error texts (e.g., “Move failed failed”).  
    ✅ Multi-file operations: You can now copy, delete, or move multiple files at once.  
    ✅ Accurate selection width: Item selection now matches the actual filename width instead of spanning the entire window.  
    ✅ Multi-select support: Hold Ctrl and left-click to select multiple items (Shift-based selection is not implemented yet).  
    ✅ Delete key support: File deletion via the Delete key should now work (note: still untested).  
    ✅ Enhanced Drag & Drop:  
        Dragging files into a terminal now pastes their paths (as plain text).  
        Dragging within the file manager performs a move operation (not a copy).
    ✅ Smoother UI interactions:  
        Directory navigation is now visually smoother.  
        Context menus appear with a more fluid animation.
